# bad-apple-wallpaper
gives you the ability to play bad apple on your wallpaper

open the loop file and change the user and install directory according to your situation
run it from your home directory with a python command
in my example i use "python3 Documents/GitHub/bad-apple-wallpaper/wallpaperchanger.py"
this is made like this so i can run the command on startup automatically

note(s): this only works with gnome - i use pop os don't @ me, AND this is fairly unstable and might crash your system
